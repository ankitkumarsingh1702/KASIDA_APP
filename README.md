Shopping Ecommerce App

Problem Statement :
As we know over a great period, many issues have been faced by these Handicrafts Workers especially with these small business craftswomen who don't have these many resources to  advertise their products and make them available to most of the people out there. So nowadays as we know technology has become an essential part of an individuals life and out of them, Mobile Application plays a major role. So it can be used to solve this problem too as it is easy to access.


Proposed Solution:
So the project proposed an "Ecommerce app ( KASIDA )", which will allow them to show their skills and handicrafts to a major population in a shorter period. So this app will display their products that will reach the customer without any mediator. 

Add Ons:

1.	This step will empower women by promoting their sense of self-worth their ability to determine their own choices, and their right to influence social change. 
2.	 Living a greener lifestyle has never been easy. So this app would only focus on adding earth-friendly products to it.
3.	This will hype the job opportunities for women. As the Indian handicraft industry has emerged as an essential economic agent revolutionizing the lives of millions of people across the country.
4.	It's also a social project as some percentage of the price paid will be given to certain NGOs which provide meals to the poor and the needy. As over 140 million daily wage-earners and migrant workers have lost their jobs in economic constriction in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic in India.

Functionality & Concepts used :

•	The App has a very simple and interactive interface which helps the user select the eco-friendly products and pay for it. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :
•	Linear and Relative Layout : To align the sub views in a line and relative view to give layoutparam to the sub views that specifies where it should go relative to other views.  
•	 Cardview with constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses cardview in constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.

    

•	Simple & Easy Views Design : Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons with setOnClickListener() made it easier for customer or user to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.
•	Firebase authentication : used for signup/login for entering user details.
•	Razor payment gateway : It would be used for payment of the product by the buyer.
•	Google drive documents used for fetching product details.
•	Kotlin coroutines: used to create asynchronous programs in a fluent way so that user will not face any difficulties while using the app. 
•	Viewmodel and LiveData and Room Database : We are also using LiveData and view model take feedback of the buyers and users to update it to local databases using Room.
